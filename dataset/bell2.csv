#: name: Table III: Cross section in energy range 0.62-1.05 GeV
#: description: Energy bin range ($\sqrt{s'}$), number of events after unfolding ($N_{\mathrm{unf}}$), corrected efficiency ($\varepsilon$), and cross section ($\sigma_{3\pi}$) for $e^{+}e^{-} \to \pi^{+} \pi^{-} \pi^{0}$ in energy range 0.62--1.05~GeV. The two uncertainties in the cross section are the statistical and systematic contributions. The statistical uncertainties for the unfolding and cross section are square roots of the diagonal components of the unfolding covariance matrix. The image shows Figure 23 in the PRD paper, and the points with error bars indicate the cross section in the table.
